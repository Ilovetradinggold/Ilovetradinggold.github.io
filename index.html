        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Parris Taylor, a driven and motivated individual with a drive for problem-solving and a passion for bringing ideas to life. Whether it's tackling complex projects or pursuing innovative solutions, I excel in environments that challenge me to grow and learn.<br>
            <br>With a strong work ethic and unwavering dedication to excellence, I've developed a unique ability to connect with people, communicate effectively, and deliver high-quality results under any circumstances. My passion for creating value and making a positive impact drives me to continually learn, improve, and push beyond my limits.<br>
            <br>I LOVE finance! I bring a unique perspective and talent, leveraging my skills to drive innovation and growth. With a strong foundation in coding, I've developed expertise in over 10 programming languages, which I've applied to various projects, including market research, bot development, model development, building datasets, analyzing company data, and bookkeeping. My journey in coding began in 7th grade, but it wasn't until I started developing my first day trading bot that I truly fell in love with programming.<br>
            <br>I'm excited to share my projects and experiences with you. I hope that my work inspires and showcases my skills, and I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals and companies who share my passion for innovation, growth, and excellence.</p>
